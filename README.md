# Monty Hall Problem Simulation
This is a statistical demonstration and simulation of the Monty Hall Problem, showcasing the mathematical advantage of switching doors when given the option. The simulation aims to prove that switching doors increases your chances of winning.

About This Simulation
In this demonstration, we eliminate any psychological factors that might influence decision-making, such as stress or the desire to change because you are prompted to do so. These psychological elements, present in real-life scenarios, may alter the outcome, but this simulation focuses purely on the mathematical probabilities.

Explanation of the Phenomenon
The core idea is based on the probabilities involved in your initial choice:

When you make your first choice, there is a 2/3 chance that you have selected a wrong door (one hiding a goat) and only a 1/3 chance that you have chosen the correct door (the one hiding the prize).
The presenter, who knows where the prize is, will always open a wrong door, leaving two doors:
Your initially chosen door.
One remaining unopened door.
By switching doors, you effectively bet on the idea that your initial choice was wrong (which happens 2/3 of the time). If your first choice was wrong, switching will always lead to the correct door.
Of course, if your initial choice was correct (with a 1/3 probability), switching will cause you to lose. However, since it is more likely that your first choice was incorrect, switching is mathematically the optimal strategy.

Conclusion
This simulation demonstrates that by switching doors when given the opportunity:

You leverage the higher probability (2/3) that your initial choice was wrong.
Switching gives you a consistent advantage over sticking with your first choice.
This purely mathematical reasoning is independent of emotional or psychological factors and serves to highlight the surprising nature of the Monty Hall Problem.
